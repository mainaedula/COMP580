# COMP580
COMP 580 Final Project

This is a create-your-own-adventure game where you have to rebuild a town using environmentally sustainable methods! This game is designed to be accessible to individuals with low vision or blindness. Text is printed to assist in debugging and feedback, but please keep in mind the usability without visuals when leaving feedback.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: At the last minute, the game started having issues with the web player. Please download Quest here (http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop) and download our game file, the_echo_architect.quest, to play. Note that this is WINDOWS ONLY! Apologies for the inconvenience while we work to resolve the compatibility issue.
