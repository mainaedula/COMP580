# COMP580
COMP 580 Final Project

This game is intended for use by students who are blind or have low-vision. The Eco-Architect is an adventure game where the player is tasked with rebuilding an island town.

Please download the "HTML_plus_sounds" folder to play locally, then simply open the html file in any browser. *For best experience, play in Safari or Firefox.*

Safari: preferred browser
Firefox: make sure autoplay of sounds is enabled
Chrome: slightly buggy even when sound is enabled--you will not hear background music or prompts to click

You can also play here (https://dupreezd.github.io), but autoplaying sounds don't work! So, you won't here the keypress prompts or background music.
